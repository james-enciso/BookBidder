This project is a proof of concept for an e-commerce platform intended for listing books for sale. Sellers post a listing of books they intend to sell. Bidders (buyers) can place offers in the form of bids on any book. Sellers can determine which offers appeal most and accept them to reveal contact information. Sellers can contact the bidder and arrange transactions personally

Things to improve upon
- email notification for bid acceptance/rejection status
- Cancellation link for bidders
- book type (physical, electronic)
- rating and review system
- types: eg. novels, magazines, newspapers
- categories: eg, mystery, romance, entertainment
- create profile page
- add ISBN as searchable term
- style the listing creation page
- add ability to view bids and accept/deny
- add ability to remove current listings
- add permissions to code to prevent unauthorized deletion
- prevent user from bidding on his own items
- add error checking to certain value inputs (ie. price)
- add style to post page
