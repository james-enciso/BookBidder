This project is a proof of concept for an e-commerce platform intended for listing books for sale. Sellers post a listing of books they intend to sell. Bidders (buyers) can place offers in the form of bids on any book. Sellers can determine which offers appeal most and accept them to reveal contact information. Sellers can contact the bidder and arrange transactions personally

Things to improve upon
- email notification for bid acceptance/rejection status
- Cancellation link for bidders
- public book search

- book type (physical, electronic)
- rating and review system
- types: eg. novels, magazines, newspapers
- categories: eg, mystery, romance, entertainment
- profile page
