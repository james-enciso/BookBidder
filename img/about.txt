Welcome to BookBidder!<br><br>

Looking to buy used books at reasonable prices? Perhaps you're a student who is tired of encountering those outdated bulletin postings around campus all to realize the seller no longer has the book. Or you're simply looking for a good read for cheap? You reached the right place!
<br><br>


BookBidder is an online platform where you can buy or sell your books with confidence.<br><br>

As a buyer, you can find books to bid by searching titles or by inputing the BookBidder ID number (BBID) of a particular listing you found. After finding a book you wish to bid on, you can input your contact information to let the seller know you are willing to purchase the book. Your information will not be visible to the seller unless the seller accepts your proposal; thus, protecting your privacy.<br><br>

As a seller, you have two types of listings you can create for your book here - public and private. With a public listing, anyone can search for your book and bid on it. With a private listing, your title is not visible unless users have a unique BookBidder ID number (BBID) that is generated when you create the listing.<br><br>

Simply print the page and post it on the public bulletin boards around campus. As long as your book is for sale, they will be able to view your listing and propose offers. View the offers and choose the one that best suits your demand. Click accept and you will see the contact information to proceed. <br><br>

It's easy and no more clutter in your email!
